# CurrencyAPI (Cocoa Pod)
A simple Cocoa pod for iOS apps to get the current exchange rate information. 
### Current State
- Uses https://api.exchangerate-api.com/ to get exchange rate info
- You can either get a list of currencies along with their exchange rates
- Or get exchange rate information for a particular currency

## Installation
If you haven't already initialised cocoapods in your project
- open the terminal
- navigate to your app directory e.g. `cd xcodeproject/`
- then run the following commands on the command line
```
pod init
vim Podfile
pod 'CurrencyAPI', :git => 'https://github.com/cptdanko/CurrencyAPI.git', :tag=> '1.0.0'
```
Remember, to add the line `pod 'CurrencyAPI...` below the lines that say `target 'YourAppName' do...`
## How to use it
If you intend to use have a look at the code snippet below to see how the API is being used in the ViewController

import UIKit
import CurrencyAPI

class HomeViewController: UIViewController, UIPickerViewDataSource, UIPickerViewDelegate, UITextFieldDelegate {

    var currenciesPickerData = [Currency]()
    var selectedCurrency: Currency?
    var lastUpdateDate: Date?
    
    let currencyAPI = APIFactory.getCurrencyAPI(type: .API_EX_RATE)!
    override func viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
        //this is just in case it takes time for the c
        currencySelectorPV.addActivityIndicator()
        currencyAPI.fetchExchangeRates(baseCur: Constants.CURRENCY_CODE.AUD) { (currencies, error, dateLastUpdated) in
           if error != nil {
               self.showErrorDialog(title: "Error!", messasge: "Trouble fetching currencies", okTxt: "OK")
           }
           if let cur = currencies {
               self.currenciesPickerData = cur
               self.reloadPickerView()
               self.lastUpdateDate = dateLastUpdated
           }
        }
    }
```
## If you want to use your own API endpoint
Sure that can work too, however you would need to make changes to the classes that implement the ExchangeRateAPI protocol i.e. have a look at the APIDotExRate file and notice the class variable
```
let EXTERNAL_API_URL: String = "https:...." 
```
Over there replace the string with your API. Note, if you use your own url, you may need to change how the fetchExchangeRates methods process the JSON data.
